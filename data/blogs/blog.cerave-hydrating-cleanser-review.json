  "slug": "cerave-hydrating-facial-cleanser-review",
  "metaDescription": "Tested CeraVe's hydrating face wash for a month. Here's how it performed on dry, sensitive skin and whether the ceramide formula delivers.",
  "content": "## Setup took about thirty seconds - pump twice, work into a light lather, rinse off. Simple enough that I started using it twice daily without thinking about it.\n\n## The Formula and Feel\n\nThis cleanser has a creamy, almost lotion-like consistency that doesn't foam up much. That threw me off initially since I'm used to foamy cleansers, but it actually works better for dry skin. The texture feels substantial without being heavy, and it spreads easily across your face.\n\nThe ceramides and hyaluronic acid are the main draws here. After using it for about three weeks, my skin definitely feels less tight after washing. My cheeks used to get that stretched, uncomfortable feeling right after cleansing - that's mostly gone now.\n\n## Daily Use Experience\n\nMorning routine: pump, massage for maybe twenty seconds, rinse with lukewarm water. It removes overnight buildup without stripping my skin. Evening use takes a bit more work if I'm wearing sunscreen or makeup, but it handles light makeup just fine.\n\nThe pump dispenser works smoothly and gives consistent amounts. Two pumps cover my whole face with some left over. The bottle design is practical - no fancy packaging, just functional.\n\n## What It Actually Cleans\n\nThis handles daily dirt, oil, and light makeup pretty well. It won't remove waterproof mascara or heavy foundation on its own, but for normal daily cleansing it's effective. My skin feels clean but not squeaky-clean, which is exactly what dry skin needs.\n\nThe gentle formula means it doesn't irritate sensitive areas around my eyes. I can use it daily without any redness or reactions, even when my skin is acting up from weather changes.\n\n## Skin Type Compatibility\n\nWorks best on normal to dry skin, as advertised. My combination skin tolerates it well - it doesn't over-dry the dry patches or make my T-zone too oily. The National Eczema Association certification seems legitimate based on how gentle it feels.\n\nIf you have very oily or acne-prone skin, this might not provide enough deep cleaning. It's designed for hydration, not oil control.\n\n## Long-term Results\n\nAfter a month of consistent use, my skin texture feels smoother and less flaky. The immediate post-wash tightness I used to experience is minimal now. It doesn't dramatically transform your skin, but it maintains moisture better than harsh cleansers.\n\nPairs well with other products in a routine - doesn't interfere with serums or moisturizers applied afterward.\n\n## Value and Availability\n\nYou can find this at most drugstores, Target, and online. The bottle lasts about two months with twice-daily use. CeraVe products are widely available, which makes repurchasing easy.\n\nThe dermatologist-developed angle isn't just marketing - the ingredient list backs up the gentle, hydrating claims. No sulfates or harsh detergents that would counteract the moisturizing ingredients.",
