Installation frame included, but does the anti-spy tech actually work?","content":"## Privacy protection that actually works\n\nLook, I'll be honest - I was skeptical about privacy screen protectors until someone literally couldn't see my banking app while sitting right next to me on a plane. That's when I realized these things might actually be worth the hype.\n\nThe Ailun privacy screen protector comes in a 3-pack, which is smart because let's face it, you're probably going to mess up the first installation. The inclusion of an installation frame is clutch here - it's basically a plastic guide that helps you line everything up perfectly. No more crooked screen protectors that drive you absolutely crazy.\n\n## Installation is surprisingly foolproof\n\nI've installed probably a dozen screen protectors over the years, and this was genuinely one of the easier experiences. The frame snaps onto your phone, and you just lower the glass into place. There are still dust particles to worry about (they include cleaning wipes and dust removal stickers), but the alignment part is taken care of.\n\nThe tempered glass feels substantial - not flimsy like some cheaper options I've tried. It's got that satisfying weight to it that makes you feel like you're actually protecting something. The rounded edges match the phone's curves nicely, so there's no weird lip or gap where dust can collect.\n\n## The privacy effect is legit\n\nHere's what I found interesting about the privacy feature: it works better than I expected, but it's not magic. Looking straight at your screen, everything appears normal with maybe just a tiny bit of dimming. But once someone tries to peek from the side - even at like a 30-degree angle - the screen goes pretty much black.\n\nI tested this extensively because, you know, science. Had my family try to see my screen from different angles, and they genuinely couldn't make out text or images once they got past about 25-30 degrees off-center. It's not a complete blackout at every angle, but it's definitely enough to keep casual shoulder surfers from reading your texts or seeing what you're browsing.\n\n## What about screen quality?\n\nThis is where things get a bit tricky. The HD quality claim is mostly accurate - colors still look good and text is crisp when you're looking straight on. But there is a slight darkening effect, which means you might find yourself cranking up the brightness a bit more than usual, especially outdoors.\n\nTouch sensitivity remains excellent. No issues with typing, swiping, or using Face ID. The case-friendly design actually delivers too - I've got a pretty thick protective case and there's no interference or lifting at the edges.\n\n## The not-so-great parts\n\nThe privacy coating does make the screen slightly more reflective, which can be annoying in bright sunlight. It's not terrible, but it's noticeable if you're coming from a regular screen protector.\n\nAlso, that dimming effect I mentioned? It's more pronounced than I'd like. Indoor lighting is fine, but outdoor use definitely requires bumping up the brightness, which hits your battery life a bit.\n\nOne more thing - while the installation frame is great, the actual glass can still pick up fingerprints and smudges pretty easily. You'll want to keep a microfiber cloth handy.\n\n## Who should actually get this?\n\nThis makes the most sense if you frequently use your phone in public spaces where people might glance over - coffee shops, public transit, offices with open floor plans. If you handle sensitive work stuff on your phone or just value your privacy, the slight trade-offs in brightness and reflection are probably worth it.\n\nFor people who mostly use their phones at home or don't care about screen privacy, you're probably better off with a regular tempered glass protector that won't dim your display.\n\n## Bottom line\n\nThe Ailun privacy screen protector does what it promises. The installation process is actually pleasant (weird thing to say about a screen protector, but here we are), the build quality feels solid, and the privacy feature works well enough to matter. Just know you're trading a bit of screen brightness for that privacy, and decide if that's worth it for your use case.","keywords":["iPhone 17 Pro screen protector","privacy screen protector","anti spy screen protector","tempered glass screen protector","Ailun screen protector","iPhone privacy screen","installation frame screen protector","case friendly screen protector"],"pros":["Installation frame makes alignment super easy","Privacy feature actually blocks side viewing effectively","Comes in 3-pack so you have backups","Tempered glass feels substantial and well-made","Touch sensitivity remains excellent after installation","Case-friendly design works with thick protective cases","Face ID continues working without issues"],"cons":["Noticeable screen dimming requires higher brightness settings","More reflective surface can be annoying in bright sunlight","Shows fingerprints and smudges more easily than regular protectors","Privacy coating slightly affects color vibrancy"],"verdict":"If you need privacy protection and don't mind slightly dimmer screen brightness, this is a solid choice that actually delivers on its promises.
