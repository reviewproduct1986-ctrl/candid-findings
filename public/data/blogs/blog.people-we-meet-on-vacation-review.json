Here's my honest take.","content":"## This Book Hit Different Than I Expected\n\nI'll be honest - I picked up People We Meet on Vacation thinking it'd be another predictable beach read. Boy, was I wrong. Emily Henry managed to write a friends-to-lovers story that doesn't feel forced or cheesy, which is honestly rare in this genre.\n\nThe story follows Poppy and Alex, two completely opposite best friends who've taken annual vacations together for years. Then something happens that ruins their friendship for two years, and the book alternates between their past trips and Poppy's attempt to fix things with one final vacation.\n\n## What Makes This Friends-to-Lovers Story Work\n\nThe friendship feels real. That's the biggest thing Henry gets right here. Poppy and Alex aren't just convenient plot devices - they're actual friends with inside jokes, shared history, and the kind of comfortable dynamic that takes years to build. You can feel how well they know each other through small details, like how Alex always packs extra snacks because he knows Poppy gets hangry.\n\nThe dual timeline structure works surprisingly well too. Instead of feeling gimmicky, jumping between past and present trips actually builds tension. You're dying to know what went wrong between them while simultaneously watching their relationship develop over the years.\n\nPoppy's character resonated with me more than I expected. She's messy in realistic ways - not the quirky, endearing mess you usually see in rom-coms, but genuinely flawed. She makes selfish decisions, struggles with feeling like she doesn't fit anywhere, and has this desperate need to be interesting that felt very authentic.\n\n## The Romance Actually Has Stakes\n\nWhat surprised me most was how much emotional weight this book carries. The romance doesn't feel inevitable or easy - there are real consequences to these characters getting together or not getting together. Their friendship matters so much to both of them that risking it for romance feels genuinely scary.\n\nThe slow burn is done right too. Henry doesn't rely on manufactured misunderstandings or artificial obstacles. The tension comes from the characters' own fears and insecurities, which makes it way more compelling.\n\n## Where It Gets a Little Wobbly\n\nThe book does drag in a few spots, particularly during some of the flashback scenes. Not all of their past vacations are equally interesting, and some feel more like filler than necessary backstory. I found myself skimming through a couple of the earlier trip chapters.\n\nAlso, while I appreciated Poppy's messiness, sometimes her self-sabotage got frustrating. There were moments where I wanted to shake her and tell her to just communicate like an adult. Though I guess that's probably the point - real people don't always handle things maturely.\n\n## The Writing Feels Natural\n\nHenry has a conversational writing style that makes the book easy to sink into. The dialogue feels authentic, especially the banter between Poppy and Alex. She also does a great job of showing their chemistry without relying too heavily on physical descriptions or over-the-top romantic moments.\n\nThe vacation settings are well-done too. Each destination feels distinct and adds something to the story rather than just being exotic window dressing.\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nPeople We Meet on Vacation succeeds because it treats friendship as seriously as romance. The relationship between Poppy and Alex feels earned and lived-in, which makes you actually care whether they end up together. It's not groundbreaking literature, but it's a solid, emotionally satisfying read that doesn't insult your intelligence.\n\nIf you're tired of romance novels where the main characters barely seem to like each other as people, this one might be exactly what you're looking for.","keywords":["friends to lovers romance","Emily Henry books","contemporary romance","beach reads","dual timeline romance","vacation romance novel","realistic friendship","slow burn romance"],"pros":["Authentic friendship foundation between main characters","Dual timeline structure builds genuine tension","Realistic character flaws and personal growth","Natural dialogue and conversational writing style","Slow burn romance with actual emotional stakes","Well-developed vacation settings that serve the story","Chemistry that feels earned rather than forced"],"cons":["Some flashback scenes feel like unnecessary filler","Pacing drags occasionally in middle sections","Protagonist's self-sabotage can get frustrating","Not all past vacation scenes are equally engaging"],"verdict":"People We Meet on Vacation delivers a genuinely satisfying friends-to-lovers romance with realistic characters and emotional depth.
