  "metaDescription": "Testing CeraVe's hydrating cleanser for dry skin - real results with ceramides and hyaluronic acid after weeks of daily use.",
  "content": "## The gel texture surprised me right away\n\nThe first squeeze from the bottle gives you this clear, slightly thick gel that doesn't foam much at all. Coming from traditional foaming cleansers, this felt weird initially - like I wasn't getting clean enough. But that's exactly the point with CeraVe's hydrating formula.\n\nThis cleanser packs three ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and glycerin into a formula that's supposed to clean without stripping your skin. The National Eczema Association stamp means it passed their standards for sensitive skin, which caught my attention since my face gets irritated easily during winter months.\n\n## How it performs on actual dry skin\n\nI've been using this morning and night for about six weeks now. The cleansing action is gentle - almost too gentle if you wear heavy makeup. It removes light makeup and daily grime without that tight, squeaky-clean feeling that usually follows face washing. My skin feels soft immediately after rinsing, not like it needs moisturizer urgently.\n\nThe ceramides and hyaluronic acid seem to do their job. My usual dry patches around my nose and cheeks have calmed down significantly. I don't get that flaky, uncomfortable feeling by midday like I used to with harsher cleansers.\n\nFor removing sunscreen and light foundation, it works fine. But if you wear waterproof mascara or long-wearing lipstick, you'll need a separate makeup remover first. This isn't really a deep-cleaning product.\n\n## The multi-use aspect works\n\nCeraVe markets this as suitable for face and body, and I've tried it on my hands and arms when they get particularly dry. It's gentle enough for these areas and doesn't leave any residue. The bottle is large enough that using it beyond just your face doesn't feel wasteful.\n\nThe pump dispenser is convenient and hygienic, though it took a few tries to figure out the right amount. One full pump covers my entire face and neck comfortably.\n\n## What dermatologist development actually means\n\nThe developed with dermatologists claim isn't just marketing fluff here. The ingredient list reads like a skincare routine in a bottle - the three essential ceramides (1, 3, 6-II) help restore your skin barrier, while hyaluronic acid draws moisture from the air.\n\nI noticed less redness and irritation compared to my previous drugstore cleanser. My skin tone looks more even, and I don't get those random breakouts that sometimes happen when switching products.\n\n## Real-world usage notes\n\nThe consistency means it doesn't drip or run while you're massaging it in. I usually work it into damp skin for about 30 seconds, then rinse with lukewarm water. It rinses clean without leaving a film, which some cream cleansers can do.\n\nOne bottle lasts about three months with twice-daily use. The packaging is straightforward - nothing fancy, but functional. The ingredient list is clearly printed, which I appreciate when checking for potential allergens.\n\n## Where it falls short\n\nThis cleanser won't deep-clean pores or remove stubborn makeup effectively. If you have oily skin or wear heavy makeup regularly, you might find it too mild. It's also not going to address active acne or provide any exfoliation.\n\nThe gel texture takes getting used to if you're accustomed to foaming cleansers. Some people equate foam with cleanliness, so this might feel insufficient initially.",
