Beautiful design, solid performance, but comes with a few quirks worth knowing about.","content":"## Compared to my old Cuisinart, this SMEG feels like kitchen jewelry\n\nThe matte champagne finish caught my eye immediately - it's more subtle than I expected from photos, with a soft metallic sheen that doesn't show fingerprints easily. After using it daily for six weeks, I can say it's definitely more than just a pretty face, though the aesthetics are undeniably the main draw.\n\n## Build Quality and Design\n\nThis thing weighs about twice what my previous toaster did, and you feel that solid construction when you lift it. The metal body feels premium throughout - no cheap plastic parts or wobbly components. The slots are wider than standard, which handles thick artisan breads and bagels without forcing them in.\n\nThe control knob has a satisfying click between settings, and the independent start button prevents accidental toasting when you're just adjusting settings. Small details like the removable crumb tray sliding out smoothly show they thought about daily use.\n\n## Performance Testing\n\nThe six browning levels give you real control. Level 2 works perfectly for my morning sourdough, while frozen waffles need about level 4 with the defrost function activated. The defrost feature adds roughly 30 seconds to toast time, which seems about right for bringing frozen bread to room temperature before browning.\n\nToasting consistency has been solid - both slices come out evenly browned, and the automatic pop-up works reliably. I've never had a slice get stuck or fail to pop up properly.\n\n## Daily Use Reality\n\nThe independent controls are genuinely useful when you want different browning levels for different breads. My partner likes darker toast than I do, so we can run one side on level 3 and the other on level 5.\n\nCleaning is straightforward with the removable crumb tray, though you'll want to empty it regularly - the tray isn't huge. The exterior wipes clean easily, and the matte finish hides water spots better than glossy surfaces.\n\n## What Could Be Better\n\nThe cord is shorter than I'd prefer - about four feet. Depending on your counter setup, you might need an extension. Also, this toaster runs slightly hotter than others I've used, so you might need to adjust your usual browning level down by one setting.\n\nThe slots, while wider than average, still struggle with really thick bagel halves. You can fit them, but they might not lower completely flush.\n\n## Who Should Consider This\n\nIf you want a toaster that looks like a design piece while handling daily breakfast duties reliably, this fits the bill. The champagne color works with both warm and cool kitchen palettes, and the retro styling adds character without being too bold.\n\nThe higher price point makes sense if aesthetics matter to you and you plan to keep it on the counter where it's visible. For pure functionality alone, there are cheaper options that toast just as well.","keywords":["SMEG toaster","matte champagne toaster","retro style toaster","wide slot toaster","defrost function toaster","premium kitchen appliances","design toaster","champagne kitchen accessories"],"pros":["Gorgeous matte champagne finish that resists fingerprints and water spots","Solid metal construction feels premium and durable compared to plastic alternatives","Six browning levels provide precise control over toast darkness","Independent controls let you toast each slot to different browning levels","Wide slots accommodate thick artisan breads and bagels without forcing","Defrost function works effectively for frozen breads and waffles","Removable stainless steel crumb tray slides out smoothly for easy cleaning"],"cons":["Short power cord limits placement options on the counter","Runs slightly hotter than average, requiring adjustment to usual browning preferences","Very thick bagel halves may not lower completely flush in the slots","Higher price point compared to basic toasters with similar functionality"],"verdict":"This SMEG toaster delivers reliable performance wrapped in genuinely beautiful design.
